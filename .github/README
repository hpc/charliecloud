This directory defines our GitHub Actions test suite setup.

The basic strategy is to start one “job” per builder; these run in parallel.
Each job then cycles through several different configurations, which vary per
builder. It is configured to “fail fast”, i.e., if one of the jobs fails, the
others will be immediately cancelled. For example, we only run the quick test
suite on one builder, but if it fails everything will stop and you still get
notified quickly.

The number of concurrent jobs is not clear to me, but I’ve seen 7 and the
documentation [1] implies it’s at least 20 (though I assume there is some
global limit for OSS projects too). Nominally, jobs are started from the left
side of the list, so anything we think is likely to fail fast (e.g., the quick
scope) should be leftward; in practice it seems to be random.

We could add more matrix dimensions, but then we’d have to deal with ordering
more carefully, and pass the Docker cache manually (or not use it for some
things).

Conventions:

  * We install everything to start, then uninstall as needed for more
    bare-bones tests.

  * For the “extra things’ tests:

    * Docker is the fastest builder, so that’s where we put extra things.

    * We need to retain sudo for uninstalling stuff.

    * I could not figure out how to set a boolean variable for use in “if”
      conditions. (I *did* get an environment variable to work, but not using
      our set/unset convention, rather the strings “true” and “false”. This
      seemed error-prone.) Therefore the extra things tests all use the full
      expression.

Miscellaneous notes and gotchas:

  * Runner specs (as of 2020-11-25), nominal: Azure Standard_DS2_v2 virtual
    machine: 2 vCPUs, 7 GiB RAM, 15 GiB SSD storage. The OS image is
    bare-bones but there is a lot of software installed in third-party
    locations [1].

    Looking at the actual VM provisioned, the disk specs are a little
    different: it’s got an 84GiB root filesystem mounted, and another 9GiB
    mounted on /mnt. With a little deleting, maybe we can make room for a
    full-scope test.

    It does seem to boot faster than Travis; overall performance is worse; but
    total test time is lower (Travis took 50–55 minutes to complete a passing
    build).

  * GitHub doesn’t seem to notice our setup if .github is a symlink. :(

  * GitHub seems to want us to encapsulate some of the steps that are now just
    shell scripts into “actions”. I haven’t looked into this.

  * Force-push does start a new build.

  * Commands in “run” blocks aren’t logged by default; you need “set -x” if
    you want to see them. However there seems to be a race condition, so the
    commands and their output aren’t always interleaved correctly.

  * “docker” does not require “sudo”.

  * There are several places where we configure, make, make install. These
    need to be kept in sync. Perhaps there is an opportunity for an “Action”
    here? But the configure output validation varies.

  * The .github directory doesn’t have a Makefile.am; the files are listed in
    the root Makefile.am.

  * Most variables are strings. It’s easy to get into a situation where you
    set a variable to “false” but it’s the string “false” so it’s true.

  * Viewing step output is glitchy:

    * While the job is in progress, sometimes the step headings are links and
      sometimes they aren’t.

    * If it does work, you can’t scroll back to the start.

    * The “in progress” throbber seems to often be on the wrong heading.

    * When it’s over, sometimes clicking on a heading opens it but the content
      is blank; in this case, clicking a different job and coming back seems
      to fix things.

To-do items for later (FIXME):

  * Can we e-mail charliecloud-dev with failures?

  * Previously we listed $CH_TEST_TARDIR and $CH_TEST_IMGDIR between phases. I
    didn’t transfer that over. It must have been useful for some reason.
    Perhaps we should do this in ch-test? Or maybe an Action is appropriate?

  * Review these and turn them into GitHub issues.

  * There is not currently a way to skip testing a commit. GitHub Actions has
    no in-built keywords like Travis’ “[skip ci]”, so we’d need to implement
    it ourselves. I did find a recipe for examining commit messages of a push
    event but not pull requests. Possibly we could look at PR tags?

  * Currently we rebuild all Dockerfiles from scratch on every job. It would
    be nice to cache these; we may be able to bring wall time down to 10–15
    minutes with caching, as it would let us use wider parallelism via more
    dimensions in the matrix. I think this is already issue #477.
    Considerations & gotchas off the top of my head:

    * Docker, Buildah, and ch-grow will all need different treatment.

    * There do seem to be Actions for caching both Docker images as well as
      generic directories. However, actions/cache at least has a limit of 5GiB
      for the whole repo, which may not help us.

  * It may be good to use the GitHub container registry. E.g. can we set it up
    as a pull-through cache from Docker Hub?
