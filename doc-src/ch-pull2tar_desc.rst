Synopsis
========

::

  $ ch-pull2tar IMAGE[:TAG] OUTDIR

Description
===========

Pull a Docker image named :code:`IMAGE[:TAG]` from Docker Hub and flatten it
into a Charliecloud tarball in directory :code:`OUTDIR`.

This runs the following command sequence: :code:`docker pull`,
:code:`ch-docker2tar` but provides less flexibility than the individual
commands.

Sudo privileges are required for :code:`docker pull`.

Additional arguments:

  :code:`--help`
    print help and exit

  :code:`--version`
    print version and exit
