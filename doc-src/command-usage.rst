.. WARNING: The one-line summaries below are duplicated in list man_pages in
   conf.py. Any updates need to be made there also.

.. Note the unusual heading level. This is so the man page .rst files can
   still use double underscores as their top-level headers, which in turn lets
   us do things like include docker_tips.rst. You will also find this in the
   man page .rst files.
