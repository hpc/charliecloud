Installation
************

This section describes how to build and install Charliecloud. For some
distributions, this can be done using your package manager; otherwise, both
normal users and admins can build and install it manually.

Dependencies
============

Charliecloud is a simple system with limited dependencies. If your system
meets these prerequisites but Charliecloud doesn't work, please report that as
a bug.

Supported architectures
-----------------------

Charliecloud should work on any architecture supported by the Linux kernel,
and we have run Charliecloud containers on x86-64, ARM, and Power. However, it
is currently tested only on x86_64 and ARM.

Most container build software is also fairly portable; e.g., see `Docker's
supported platforms <https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms>`_.

Run time
--------

Systems used for running images need:

* Recent Linux kernel with user namespaces enabled. We recommend version 4.4
  or higher.

* C11 compiler and standard library

* POSIX.1-2017 shell and utilities

The SquashFS workflow requires FUSE and `Squashfuse
<https://github.com/vasi/squashfus>`_. Note that distribution packages of
Squashfuse often provide only the "high level" executables; the "low level"
executables have better performance. These can be installed from source on any
distribution.

Some distributions need configuration changes to enable user namespaces. For
example:

* Debian Stretch `needs sysctl <https://superuser.com/a/1122977>`_
  :code:`kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1`.

* RHEL/CentOS 7.4 and 7.5 need both a `kernel command line option and a sysctl <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/getting_started_with_containers/#user_namespaces_options>`_.
  *Important note:* Docker does not work with user namespaces, so skip step 4
  of the Red Hat instructions, i.e., don't add :code:`--userns-remap` to the
  Docker configuration (see `issue #97
  <https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud/issues/97>`_).

Build time
----------

Systems used for building images need the run-time dependencies, plus
something to actually build the images.

A common choice is `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_, along with internet
access or configuration for a local Docker repository. Our wrapper scripts for
Docker expect to run the :code:`docker` command under :code:`sudo` and need
Docker 17.03+ and :code:`mktemp(1)`. (Older versions of Docker may work but
are untested. We know that 1.7.1 does not work.)

Optional build-time dependencies:

* Bash 4.1+, for :code:`ch-build2dir`
* :code:`squashfs-tools` for creating SquashFS image files

Test suite
----------

To run the test suite, you also need:

* `Bats <https://github.com/sstephenson/bats>`_ 0.4.0
* Bash 4.1+, for Bats and to make programming the tests tractable
* Python 2.7 or 3.4+, for building some of the tests
* Wget, to download stuff for some of the test images
* root access via :code:`sudo` (optional), to test filesystem permissions enforcement

Image building software tested, with varying levels of thoroughness:

* Shell scripts with various manual bootstrap and :code:`ch-run`
* Docker
* `Buildah <https://github.com/containers/buildah>`_
* `skopeo <https://github.com/containers/skopeo>`_ and
  `umoci <https://github.com/openSUSE/umoci>`_

Bats can be installed at the system level or embedded in the Charliecloud
source code. If it's in both places, the latter is used.

To embed Bats, either:

* Download Charliecloud using :code:`git clone --recursive`, which will check
  out Bats as a submodule in :code:`test/bats`.

* Unpack the Bats zip file or tarball in :code:`test/bats`.

To check an embedded Bats::

  $ test/bats/bin/bats --version
  Bats 0.4.0


Package manager install
=======================

Charliecloud is available in some distribution package repositories, and
packages can be built for additional distributions. (Note, however, that
system-wide installation is not required â€” Charliecloud works fine when built
by any user and run from one's home directory or similar.)

This section describes how to obtain packages for the distributions we know
about, and where to go for support on them.

If you'd like to build one of the packages, or if you're a package maintainer,
see :code:`packaging/README` and :code:`packaging/*/README` for additional
documentation.

Pull requests and other collaboration to improve the packaging situation are
particularly welcome!

Debian

Manual build and install
========================

Download
--------

See our GitHub project: https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud

The recommended download method is :code:`git clone --recursive`.

Build
-----

To build, simply::

  $ make

To build the documentation, see :ref:`the contributor's guide <doc-build>`.

Install (optional)
------------------

You can run Charliecloud from the source directory, and it's recommended you
at least run the test suite before installation to establish that your system
will work.

To install (FHS-compliant)::

  $ make install PREFIX=/foo/bar

Note that :code:`PREFIX` is required. It does not default to
:code:`/usr/local` like many packages.
