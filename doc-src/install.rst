Installation
************

This section describes how to build and install Charliecloud. For some
distributions, this can be done using your package manager; otherwise, both
normal users and admins can build and install it manually.

Package manager install
=======================

Charliecloud is available in some distribution package repositories, and
packages can be built for additional distributions. (Note, however, that
system-wide installation is not required â€” Charliecloud works fine when built
by any user and run from one's home directory or similar.)

This section describes how to obtain packages for the distributions we know
about, and where to go for support on them.

If you'd like to build one of the packages, or if you're a package maintainer,
see :code:`packaging/README` and :code:`packaging/*/README` for additional
documentation.

Pull requests and other collaboration to improve the packaging situation are
particularly welcome!
