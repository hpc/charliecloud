openSUSE packages are maintained and built using the openSUSE Build
Service (OBS) at https://build.opensuse.org

To use OBS to create your own charliecloud packages, you'll need to
create a user account and then copy the packaging from the devel
package at:

https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/network:cluster/charliecloud

This can be done from the web interface clicking on "Branch package".

Then you will be able to fetch locally all the packaging files from
your copy (or branch), make your changes and send them to OBS that will
build packages and create package repositories for your branch.

The beginner's guide on how to use OBS with the osc command-line tool
can be found at https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-beginners-guide/
