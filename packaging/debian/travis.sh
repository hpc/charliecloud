# FIXME: This uses the latest debian/changelog entry to choose the package
# version, which is wrong most of the time. I'd really like to just be able to
# say "debuild" at the source code root, without needing e.g. sed beforehand.
# What is the best practice here? This must not be the only package with this
# problem.
