This directory contains the code for distribution packages of Charliecloud.

To build packages (end users generally do not need to do this), consult the
README in the subdirectory of interest.

Note that packaging code is not supported by the Charliecloud developers but
rather by downstream maintainers. The Charliecloud team defers to these
maintainers for non-trivial pull requests in this directory.

However, package maintainers are requested to follow these guidelines:

1. Web documentation (install.rst) should cover:

   a. which packages are available
   b. how to install them, given prior installation experience for that distro
   c. who's responsible for a given distro's packages
   d. where to go for questions and bug reports on the package

2. Documentation in this directory should cover:

   a. how to build the packages, given prior experience building for that
      distro (i.e., teaching someone how to build packages for a given distro
      is out of scope)

3. Packaging code should:

   a. follow distro best practices and style
   b. build a reasonably-versioned package for arbitrary Git versions (e.g.,
      not use the top of the package changelog for random later commits)
   c. provide package build tests for Travis when practical
