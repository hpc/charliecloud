    # 1. mktemp(1) isn't POSIX, but it seemed very likely to be installed if
    #    Docker is, and I couldn't find a more portable way of securely
    #    creating temporary files. (In particular, I would've preferred to
    #    pipe rather than creating and deleting a temporary file.)
    #
    # 2. Blocking factor 1 (-b1) for tar is a bug workaround. Without this
    #    switch, tar 1.26, which is in RHEL, corrupts the tarball instead of
    #    appending to it. This doesn't happen in 1.29 in Debian Stretch, and
    #    building GNU tar from Git source was too hard, so I couldn't bisect a
    #    specific commit that fixed the bug to learn what exactly was going
    #    on. (See PR #371.)

    #    top-level directory (i.e., is a tarbomb).
