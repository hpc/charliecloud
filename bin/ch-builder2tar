Flatten a builder image into a Charliecloud image tarball.

Usage:

)

# Note regarding the environment variables file /ch/environment, which for
# many builders is appended to the exported tarball:
#
# 1. mktemp(1) isn't POSIX, but it seemed very likely to be installed if any
#    fancy builder is, and I couldn't find a more portable way of securely
#    creating temporary files. (In particular, I would've preferred to pipe
#    rather than creating and deleting a temporary file.)
#
# 2. Blocking factor 1 (-b1) for tar is a bug workaround. Without this switch,
#    tar 1.26, which is in RHEL, corrupts the tarball instead of appending to
#    it. This doesn't happen in 1.29 in Debian Stretch, and building GNU tar
#    from Git source was too hard, so I couldn't bisect a specific commit that
#    fixed the bug to learn what exactly was going on. (See PR #371.)
#
# 3. This assumes that the exported tarball does not have a single top-level
#    directory (i.e., is a tarbomb).

    # FIXME: check that the variant is valid.

    # Possible methods to create a tarball:
    #
    #   1. "buildah from", "buildah commit --squash", export to OCI image with
    #      "buildah push", manually copy out the tarball of the single layer.
    #      This requires rooting around in the OCI image (brittle in shell)
    #      and doesn't let us choose whether the tarball is compressed.
    #
    #   2. Above, but flatten with "umoci" and then tar up the resulting
    #      rootfs. The advantage here is that it uses only documented
    #      commands; the downsides are that it introduces a redundant
    #      unpack/repack of tarballs and a dependency.
    #
    #   3. "buildah inspect --format='{{.OCIv1.RootFS}}'" gives us the root
    #      filesystem hash but we'd have to find the rest of its path somehow.
    #
    #   4. "buildah mount" and "unmount" and tar up the rootfs directory. This
    #      requires wrapping everything with "buildah unshare", which is a
    #      rather ugly subshell. Also, I'm not sure how to get pv(1) in there.
    #
    #      (On my box, the container rootfs is accessible without "buildah
    #      unshare" but I'm guessing that depends on the storage driver.)
    #
    #   5. "buildah export". The main problem here is that the subcommand does
    #      not exist, though it used to [1,2]. A secondary issue is that it
    #      required starting up a container [3], which we don't want.
    #
    #   6. "podman export". Podman (formerly kpod) is a container runtime [4];
    #      it can create a container and then export its filesystem. The
    #      addition of the export command is why "buildah export" was removed
    #      [2]. We haven't looked into this in detail. It appears to be
    #      Buildah's recommended approach but would add a dependency.
    #
    # Currently we do #3.
