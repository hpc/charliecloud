# The basic algorithm here is that we build up a list of file
# source:destination pairs separated by newlines, then walk through them and
# copy them into the image. We also maintain a list of directories to create
# and a list of file globs to remove.
#
# The colon separator to avoid the difficulty of iterating through a sequence
# of pairs with no arrays or structures in POSIX sh. We could avoid it by
# taking action immediately upon encountering each file in the argument list,
# but that would (a) yield a half-injected image for basic errors like
# misspellings on the command line and (b) would require the image to be first
# on the command line, which seems awkward.
#
# The newline separator is for the same reason and also because it's
# convenient for input from --cmd and --file.
#
# Note on looping through the newlines in a variable: The approach in this
# script is to set IFS to newline, loop, then restore. This is awkward but
# seemed the least bad. Alternatives include:
#
#   1. Piping echo into "while read -r": This executes the while in a
#      subshell, so variables don't stick.
#
#   2. Here document used as input, e.g.:
#
#        while IFS= read -r FILE; do
#          ...
#        done <<EOF
#        $FILES
#        EOF
#
#      This works but seems more awkward.
#
#   3. Here string, e.g. 'while IFS= read -r FILE; do ... done <<< "$FILES"'.
#      This is a bashism.

Inject files from the host into an image directory.

NOTE: This command is experimental. Features may be incomplete and/or buggy.

Usage:

  $ ch-fromhost [OPTION ...] [FILE_OPTION ...] IMGDIR

Which files to inject (one or more required; can be repeated):

  -c, --cmd CMD    listed in the stdout of CMD
  -f, --file FILE  listed in file FILE
  -p, --path PATH  inject the file at PATH
  --cray-mpi       Cray-enable an MPICH installed within the image
  --nvidia         recommended by nVidia (via "nvidia-container-cli list")

Destination within image:

  -d, --dest DST   place following files in IMGDIR/DST, overriding inference

Options:

  --lib-path       print the inferred destination for shared libraries
  --no-ldconfig    don't run ldconfig even if we injected shared libraries
  -h, --help       print this help and exit
  -v, --verbose    list the injected files
  --version        print version and exit
