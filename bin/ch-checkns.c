/* This example program walks through the complete namespace / pivot_root(2)
   dance to enter a Charliecloud container, with each step documented. If you
   can compile it and run it without error as a normal user, ch-run will work
   too (if not, that's a bug). If not, this will hopefully help you understand
   more clearly what went wrong.

   pivot_root(2) has a large number of error conditions resulting in EINVAL
   that are not documented in the man page [1]. The ones we ran into are:

     1. The new root cannot be shared [2] outside the mount namespace. This
        makes sense, as we as an unprivileged user inside our namespace should
        not be able to change privileged things owned by other namespaces.

        This condition arises on systemd systems, which mount everything
        shared by default.

     2. The new root must not have been mounted before unshare(2), and/or it
        must be a mount point. The man page says "new_root does not have to be
        a mount point", but the source code comment says "[i]t must be a mount
        point" [3]. (I haven't isolated which was our problem.) In either
        case, this is a very common situation.

     3. The old root is a "rootfs" [4]. This is documented in a source code
        comment [3] but not the man page. This is an unusual situation for
        most contexts, because the rootfs is typically the initramfs
        overmounted during boot. However, some cluster provisioning systems,
        e.g. Perceus, use the original rootfs directly.

   Regarding overlayfs: It's very attractive to union-mount a tmpfs over the
   read-only image; then all programs can write to their hearts' desire, and
   the image does not change. This also simplifies the code. Unfortunately,
   overlayfs + userns is not allowed as of 4.4.23. See:
