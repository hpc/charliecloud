# The lustre-client rpm has a dependency on the kmod-lustre-client rpm, this is
# not required for our tests and frequently is incompatible with the kernel
# headers in the container, using the --nodeps flag to work around this.

# NOTE: The --nodeps flag ignores all dependencies not just kmod-lustre-client,
# this could surpress a legitimate failure at build time and lead to odd
# behavior at runtime.
