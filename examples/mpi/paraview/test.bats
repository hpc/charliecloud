# The first two tests demonstrate ParaView as an "executable" to process a
# non-containerized input deck (cone.py) and produce non-containerized output.
#
#   .png: In previous versions, PNG output is antialiased with a single rank
#         and not with multiple ranks depending on the execution environment.
#	  This is no longer the case as of version 5.5.4 but may change with
#   	  a new version of Paraview.
#
#   .vtk: The number of extra and/or duplicate points and indexing of these
#         points into polygons varied by rank count on my VM, but not on the
#         cluster. The resulting VTK file is dependent on whether an image was
#         rendered serially or using 2 or n processes.
#
# We do not check .pvtp (and its companion .vtp) output because it's a
# collection of XML files containing binary data and it seems too hairy to me.
