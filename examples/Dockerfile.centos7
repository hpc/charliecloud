# This image has two purposes: (1) demonstrate we can build a CentOS 7 image
# and (2) provide a build environment for Charliecloud EPEL 7 RPMs.

RUN yum -y install epel-release

# Re. ch-grow: Like apt(8), Yum/RPM like to chown(2), etc., if they believe they
# are root. This fails in an unprivileged user namespace because UID 0 is fake.
# Unlike apt, RPM makes these system calls directly, so there's no opportunity
# for kludges like linking chown(1) to true(1). For example:
#
#    Updating   : 1:dbus-1.10.24-13.el7_6.x86_64                            2/4
#  Error unpacking rpm package 1:dbus-1.10.24-13.el7_6.x86_64
#  error: unpacking of archive failed on file /usr/libexec/dbus-1/dbus-daemon-launch-helper;5cffd726: cpio: chown
#    Cleanup    : 1:dbus-libs-1.10.24-12.el7.x86_64                         3/4

# We can instead use fakeroot(1), though there seems to be a performance
# impact. In the interest of time, we demonstrate this by installing the
# openssh package, required by git, which reliably tickles the problem.
# See issue #472.
