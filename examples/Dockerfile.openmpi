# ch-test-scope: full
FROM centos8

# A key goal of this Dockerfile is to demonstrate best practices for building
# OpenMPI for use inside a container.
#
# This OpenMPI aspires to work close to optimally on clusters with any of the
# following interconnects:
#
#    - Ethernet (TCP/IP)
#    - InfiniBand (IB)
#    - Omni-Path (OPA)
#    - RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) interconnects
#
# with no environment variables, command line arguments, or additional
# configuration files. Thus, we try to implement decisions at build time.
#
# This is a work in progress, and we're very interested in feedback.
#
# OpenMPI has numerous ways to communicate messages [1]. The ones relevant to
# this build and the interconnects they support are:
#
#   Module        Eth   IB    OPA   RoCE    note  decision
#   ------------  ----  ----  ----  ----    ----  --------
#
#   ob1 : tcp      Y*    X     X     X      a     include
#   ob1 : openib   N     Y     Y     Y      b,c   exclude
#   cm  : psm2     N     N     Y*    N            include
#       : ucx      Y?    Y*    N     Y?     b,d   include
#
#   Y : supported
#   Y*: best choice for that interconnect
#   X : supported but sub-optimal
#
#   a : No RDMA, so performance will suffer.
#   b : Uses libibverbs.
#   c : Will be removed in OpenMPI 5.
#   d : Uses Mellanox libraries if available in preference to libibverbs.
#
# You can check what's available with:
#
#   $ ch-run /var/tmp/openmpi -- ompi_info | egrep '(btl|mtl|pml)'
#
# The other build decisions are:
#
#   1. PMI/PMIx: Include these so that we can use srun or any other PMI[x]
#      provider, with no matching OpenMPI needed on the host.
#
#   2. --disable-pty-support to avoid "pipe function call failed when
#      setting up I/O forwarding subsystem".
#
#   3. --enable-mca-no-build=plm-slurm to support launching processes using
#      the host's srun (i.e., the container OpenMPI needs to talk to the host
#      Slurm's PMI) but prevent OpenMPI from invoking srun itself from within
#      the container, where srun is not installed (the error messages from
#      this are inscrutable).
