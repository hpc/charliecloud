We’d prefer to run the ObsPy test suite, but it seems quite finicky and we
weren’t able to get it to work. Problems with the test suite include:

  1. Requires network access even for the non-network modules. We filed an
     issue about this [1] that did result in likely-actionable exclusions,
     though we haven’t followed up. ObsPy also has a PR [2] unmerged as of
     2021-08-04 that could replay the network traffic offline.

  2. Expects to write within the install directory (e.g.,
     site-packages/obspy/clients/filesystem/tests/data/tsindex_data), which is
     an antipattern even when not containerized.

  3. LOTS of warnings, e.g. hundreds of deprecation gripes from NumPy as well
     as ObsPy itself.

  4. Various errors, e.g. “AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute
     'lower'” from within Matplotlib. (I was able to solve this one by
     choosing an older version of Matplotlib than the one depended on by the
     ObsPy Conda package, but we don't have time to maintain that.)

  5. Can’t get it to pass. ;)

See also issue #64.

Bottom line, I would love for an ObsPy person to maintain this example with
passing ObsPy tests, but we don't have time to do so.
