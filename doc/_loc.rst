We pride ourselves on keeping Charliecloud lightweight and simple. The lines
of code as of version 0.29 is:

.. list-table::

   * - Program itself
     - 6381
   * - Test suite & examples
     - 9983
   * - Documentation
     - 4877
   * - Build system
     - 1138
   * - Packaging
     - 617
   * - Miscellaneous
     - 410
   * - Total
     - 23406

These include code only, excluding blank lines and comments. They were counted
using `cloc <https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc>`_ version 1.86.
We typically quote the "Program itself" number when describing the size of
Charliecloud. (Please do not quote the size in Priedhorsky and Randles 2017,
as that number is very out of date.)
