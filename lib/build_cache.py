# Note on how we use Git:
#
# Git is extremely flexible and can be configured in many ways, including
# various configuration files [1] as well as environment variables [2]. We do
# our best to use a fully-isolated Git that brings along no external
# configuration the user or system may have, by excluding configuration files
# other than Charliecloud’s and clearing the environment.
#
# Another gotcha that is not (yet?) documented is $PATH. git(1) re-executes
# itself in the same way that it was invoked; e.g., if you invoke it with
# plain “git”, which looks up the binary in the path, then sub-invocations
# will do the same and look up “git” again [3]. If somehow you use different
# paths to find the outer and inner Git — which is easy to do accidentally
# with subprocess — you can run a mixed-version Git, which is bad (see #1606).
# We work around this by looking up git(1) once and then calling it by its
# absolute path, with an empty environment including unset $PATH.
#
# Alternately, we could have sanitized the environment more carefully, passing
# through $PATH and perhaps other variables. This seemed difficult to do
# correctly (e.g., should we keep $LD_LIBRARY_PATH?), and it seemed unlikely
# that Git would be executing programs other than Git that weren’t readily
# available in the standard paths or using any non-standard features.

   # metadata for the build cache. This includes re-creating some files from
   # their metadata, for files that Git can’t store or breaks.
   #
   # Importantly, this class must support un-pickling of old versions of
   # itself, to support existing build caches on upgrade. At present, we do
   # this attribute-by-attribute, without explicit versioning. We omit
   # __slots__ so old versions with since-deleted attributes can be unpickled.
   #
   # Note that ctime can’t be restored: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/36105
   #
   # Attributes corresponding directly to inode(7) fields (and pickled):
   #
   #   atime_ns
   #   mtime_ns
   #   mode
   #
   #   size .......... Size of the file in bytes. Note large file thresholds
   #                   vary between builds, so this attribute should not be
   #                   used to determine if a file is in large file storage.
   #                   WARNING: May be -1 if read from an old pickle.
   #
   # Other attributes stored in pickle:
   #
   #   children ...... Insertion-ordered mapping from child names to their
   #                   File_Metadata objects. Empty if non-directory, or upon
   #                   object creation (i.e., caller must assemble the tree).
   #
   #   dont_restore .. If True, file should not be restored (e.g., RPM
   #                   database cache files).
   #
   #   large_name .... If non-None, file is stored out-of-band as a large file
   #                   with this name. This is a function of all the
   #                   attributes that make file large-unique, i.e., two files
   #                   with the same large_name are considered the same file.
   #
   #   hardlink_to ... If non-None, file is a hard link to this other file,
   #                   stored as a Path object relative to the image root.
   #
   # Attributes not stored (recomputed on unpickle):
   #
   #   image_root .... Absolute path to the image directory to which path is
   #                   relative. That is, image_root // path is the absolute
   #                   version of path.
   #
   #   path .......... Path to the file within the image, relative to the
   #                   image root. Empty for the image root itself. For
   #                   example, an image’s “/bin/true” has path “bin/true”.
   #
   #   path_abs ...... Absolute path to the file (under the host root).

      """Recursively walk the given image root, prepare it for a Git commit,
         and return the resulting File_Metadata tree describing it. This is
         mostly reversed by git_restore_walk(); anything not is noted.

         path is the path relative to image_root currently being examined;
         hardlinks is a dictionary used to track what hard link groups have
         been seen already. External callers should pass None.

         For each file, in this order:

           1. Record file metadata, specifically mode and timestamps, because
              Git does not save metadata beyond a limited executable bit.
              (More may be saved in the future; see issue #1287.)

              This captures FIFOs (named pipes), which are ignored by Git.

              Exception: Sockets are ignored. Like FIFOs, sockets are ignored
              by Git, but there isn’t a meaningful way to re-create them.
              Their presence in a container image that is not in use, which
              this image shouldn’t be, most likely reflects a bug in
              something. We do print a warning in this case.

           2. For directories, record the number of children. Git does not
              save empty directories, so this is used to re-create them.

           3. For devices, exit with error. Such files should not appear in
              unprivileged container images, so their presence means something
              is wrong.

           4. For non-directories with link count greater than 1 (i.e., hard
              links), do nothing when the first link is encountered, but
              second and subsequent links are deleted, to be restored on
              checkout. (Git splits multiply-linked files into separate
              files, and directories cannot be hard-linked [1].)

           5. Files special due to their name:

              a. Names starting in “.git” are special to Git. Therefore,
                 except at the root where “.git” files support the cache’s Git
                 worktree, rename them to begin with “.weirdal_” instead.

              b. Files matching the pattern /var/lib/rpm/__db.* are Berkeley
                 DB database support files used by RPM. Sometimes, something
                 mishandles the last-modified dates on these files, fooling
                 Git into thinking they have not been modified, and so they
                 don’t get committed or restored, which confuses BDB/RPM.
                 Fortunately, they can be safely deleted, and that’s a simple
                 workaround, so we do it. See issue #1351.

         Return the File_Metadata tree, and if write is True, also save it in
         “ch/git.pickle”.
