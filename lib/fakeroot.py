   # General notes:
   #
   # 1. Semantics of these configurations. (Character limits are to support
   #    tidy code and message formatting.)
   #
   #    a. This is a dictionary of configurations, which themselves are
   #       dictionaries.
   #
   #    b. Key is an arbitrary tag; user-visible. There's no enforced
   #       character set but let's stick with [a-z0-9_] for now and limit to
   #       at most 10 characters.
   #
   #    c. A configuration has the following keys.
   #
   #       name ... Human-readable name for the configuration. Max 46 chars.
   #
   #       match .. Tuple; first item is the name of a file and the second is
   #                a regular expression. If the regex matches any line in the
   #                file, that configuration is used for the image.
   #
   #       init ... List of tuples containing POSIX shell commands to perform
   #                fakeroot installation and any other initialization steps.
   #
   #                Item 1: Command to detect if the step is necessary. If the
   #                  command exits successfully, the step is already
   #                  complete; if unsuccessful, it is still needed. The sense
   #                  of the test is so something like "is command FOO
   #                  available?", which seems the most common command, does
   #                  not require negation.
   #
   #                  The test should be fairly permissive; e.g., if the image
   #                  already has a fakeroot implementation installed, but
   #                  it's a different one than we would have chosen, the
   #                  command should succeed.
   #
   #                  IMPORTANT: This command must have no side effects,
   #                  because it is normally run in all matching images, even
   #                  if --force is not specified. Note that talking to the
   #                  internet is a side effect!
   #
   #                Item 2: Command to do the init step.
   #
   #                I.e., to perform each fakeroot initialization step,
   #                ch-image does roughly:
   #
   #                  if ( ! $CMD_1 ); then
   #                      $CMD_2
   #                  fi
   #
   #                For both commands, the output is visible to the user but
   #                is not analyzed.
   #
   #       cmds ... List of RUN command words that need fakeroot injection.
   #                Each item in the list is matched against each
   #                whitespace-separated word in the RUN instructions. For
   #                example, suppose that each is the list "dnf", "rpm", and
   #                "yum"; consider the following RUN instructions:
   #
   #                  RUN ['dnf', 'install', 'foo']
   #                  RUN dnf install foo
   #
   #                These are fairly standard forms. "dnf" matches both, the
   #                first on the first element in the list and the second
   #                after breaking the shell command on whitespace.
   #
   #                  RUN true&&dnf install foo
   #
   #                This third example does *not* match (false negative)
   #                because breaking on whitespace yields "true&&dnf",
   #                "install", and "foo"; none of these words are "dnf".
   #
   #                  RUN echo dnf install foo
   #
   #                This final example *does* match (false positive) becaus
   #                the second word *is* "dnf"; the algorithm isn't smart
   #                enough to realize that it's an argument to "echo".
   #
   #                The last two illustrate that the algorithm uses simple
   #                whitespace delimiters, not even a partial shell parser.
   #
   #       each ... List of words to prepend to RUN instructions that match
   #                cmd_each. For example, if each is ["fr", "-z"], then these
   #                instructions:
   #
   #                  RUN ['dnf', 'install', 'foo']
   #                  RUN dnf install foo
   #
   #                become:
   #
   #                   RUN ['fr', '-z', 'dnf', 'install', 'foo']
   #                   RUN ['fr', '-z', '/bin/sh', '-c', 'dnf install foo']
   #
   #                (Note that "/bin/sh -c" is how shell-form RUN instructions
   #                are executed regardless of --force.)
   #
   # 2. The first match wins. However, because dictionary ordering can't be
   #    relied on yet, since it was introduced in Python 3.6 [1], matches
   #    should be disjoint.
   #
   #    [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict
   #
   # 3. A matching configuration is considered applicable if any of the
   #    fakeroot-able commands are present. We do nothing if the config isn't
   #    applicable. We do not look for other matches.
   #
   # 4. There are three implementations of fakeroot that I could find:
   #    fakeroot, fakeroot-ng, and pseudo. As of 2020-09-02:
   #
   #    * fakeroot-ng and pseudo use a daemon process, while fakeroot does
   #      not. pseudo also uses a persistent database.
   #
   #    * fakeroot-ng does not support ARM; pseudo supports many architectures
   #      including ARM.
   #
   #    * “Old” fakeroot seems to have had version 1.24 on 2019-09-07 with
   #      the most recent commit 2020-08-12.
   #
   #    * fakeroot-ng is quite old: last upstream release was 0.18 in 2013,
   #      and its source code is on Sourceforge.
   #
   #    * pseudo is aslo a bit old: last upstream version was 1.9.0 on
   #      2018-01-20, and the last Git commit was 2019-08-02.
   #
   #    Generally, we select the first one that seems to work in the order
   #    fakeroot, pseudo, fakeroot-ng.
   #
   # 5. Why grep a specified file vs. simpler alternatives?
   #
   #    * Look at image name: Misses derived images, large number of tags
   #      seems a maintenance headache, :latest changes.
   #
   #    * grep the same file for each distro: No standardized file for this.
   #
   #    * Ask lsb_release(1): Not always installed, requires executing ch-run.

   # CentOS/RHEL notes:
   #
   # 1. CentOS seems to have only fakeroot, which is in EPEL, not the standard
   #    repos.
   #
   # 2. Unlike on CentOS, RHEL doesn't have the epel-release rpm in the
   #    standard repos, install via rpm for both to be consistent.
   #
   # 3. Enabling EPEL can have undesirable side effects, e.g. different
   #    version of things in the base repo that breaks other things. Thus,
   #    when we are done with EPEL, we uninstall it. Existing EPEL
   #    installations are left alone.
   #
   # 4. "yum repolist" has a lot of side effects, e.g. locking the RPM
   #    database and asking configured repos for something or other.

   # Debian/Ubuntu notes:
   #
   # 1. In recent Debian-based distributions apt(8) runs as an unprivileged
   #    user by default. This makes *all* apt operations fail in an
   #    unprivileged container because it can't drop privileges. There are
   #    multiple ways to turn the “sandbox” off. AFAICT, none are documented,
   #    but this one at least appears in Google searches a lot.
   #
   #    apt also doesn't drop privileges if there is no user _apt; in my
   #    testing, sometimes this user is present and sometimes not, for reasons
   #    I don't understand. If not present, you get this warning:
   #
   #      W: No sandbox user '_apt' on the system, can not drop privileges
   #
   #    Configuring apt not to use the sandbox seemed cleaner than deleting
   #    this user and eliminates the warning.
   #
   # 2. If we wanted to test if a fakeroot package was installed, we could say:
   #
   #      dpkg-query -Wf '${Package}\n' \
   #      | egrep '^(fakeroot|fakeroot-ng|pseudo)$'
