# This script generates a BATS file to exercise "ch-image build --force"
# across a variety of distributions. It's used by Makefile.am.
#
# About each distribution, we remember:
#
#   - base image name
#   - config name it should select
#   - scope
#       standard: all tests in standard scope
#       full: one test in standard scope, the rest in full
#   - any tests invalid for that distro
#
# For each distribution, we test these factors:
#
#   - whether or not --force is given (2)
#   - whether or not preparation for --force is already done (2)
#   - commands that (4)
#       - don't need --force, and fail
#       - don't need --force, and succeed
#       - apparently need --force but in fact do not
#       - really do need --force
#
# This would appear to yield 2×2×4 = 16 tests per distribution. However:
#
#   1. We only try pre-prepared images for "really need" commands with --force
#      given, to save time, so it's at most 9 potential tests.
#
#   2. Some distros don't have any pre-preparation step, so that test doesn't
#      make sense.
#
#   3. Some distros don't have an "apparently need" command determined.
#
# Bottom line, the number of tests per distro varies. See the code below for
# specific details.
