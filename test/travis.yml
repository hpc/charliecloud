# This defines a "matrix" of jobs. Each combination of environment variables
# defines a different job. They run in parallel, five at a time. We have
# divided the matrix into "stages"; if any stage has a failure, testing stops
# and the remaining stages are skipped. Note that some stages are conditional.
#
# Note: Matrixing of variables that happens at the top level is not supported
# within stages: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/8295.
#
# We do not do any full-scope tests, because they give a >10-minute gap in
# output, so Travis times out.
#
# FIXME: Each job starts with a cold Docker cache, which wastes work heating
# it up in parallel. It would be nice if "make test-build" could be done
# serially before splitting into parallel jobs.

#   TARBALL=              # build in Git checkout
#   TARBALL=archive       # build from "git archive" tarball
#   TARBALL=export        # build from "make export" tarball
#   INSTALL=              # run from build directory
#   INSTALL=yes           # make install to /usr/local, run that one

# Additional options:
#
#   CH_BUILDER              # which builder to use
#   MINIMAL_DEPS            # test with minimal dependencies (no fancy tools)
#   SUDO_RM_FIRST           # remove sudo before build (implied if non-Docker)
#   SUDO_RM_AFTER_BUILD     # remove sudo after build
#   SUDO_AVOID_AFTER_BUILD  # set CH_TEST_DONT_SUDO after build
