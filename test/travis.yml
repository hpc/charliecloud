# This defines a "matrix" of jobs. Each combination of environment variables
# defines a different job. They run in parallel, five at a time.

# FIXME: Each job starts with a cold Docker cache, which wastes work heating
# it up in parallel. It would be nice if "make test-build" could be done
# serially before splitting into parallel jobs.

# Ubuntu Trusty symlinks /dev/shm -> /run/shm; the latter is unavailable after
# entering the namespaces and we get ENOENT. Work around this bug. See:

# The following is the mess needed to get a working ShellCheck on Travis.
# Approaches that don't work include:
#
#   - Static binary provided by ShellCheck upstream (0.5.0): Segfault due to
#     Trusty bug [1]. The described workaround didn't work for me.
#
#   - Compile from source (0.5.0): Build is supposedly very long (30 minutes)
#     and one must install the Haskell build environment.
#
#   - Travis-provided (0.4.6): Segfault again, I think for the same reason.
#
#   - Ubunty Trusty, i.e. plain "apt-get" (0.3.3): Super old.
#
#   - Debian Sid (0.4.7): glibc dependency too new, default dpkg can't read
#     the .deb because it's xz-compressed, and only gain one point release.
#
# Once Travis finally gets around to upgrading Ubuntu [2], we should just
# install the static binary.
