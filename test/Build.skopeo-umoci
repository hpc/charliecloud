# Build an Alpine Linux image using skopeo and umoci. This is a precursor to
# proper support within the tools (issue #325).
#
# Note that this approach is a little contrived, in that we unpack the image
# with umoci, tar it up, and then later in the test suite unpack it again
# redundantly with ch-tar2dir. Many real workflows would just use the
# umoci-unpacked image. (umoci does not support producing a tarball directly.)
#
# Warning: This image currently tests the case of a tarball with one top-level
# directory and no hidden files. If you remove it, make sure regressions on
# issue #332 are still tested.
