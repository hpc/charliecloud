# This Dockerfile is used to test image with an OCI manifest (issue #1184).
#
# WARNING: The manifest is produced by the build tool and is rather opaque.
# Specifically, re-building the image might silently produce a different
# manifest that also works, negating the value of this test. Building this
# image with Podman 3.0.1 did trigger the above issue; Podman 3.4.0 very
# likely has the same behavior. Bottom line, be very cautious about
# re-building this image. One approach would be to comment out the content
# types added by #1184 and see if the updated image still triggers the bug.
#
# Scope is "skip" because we pull it to test; see test/build/50_pull.bats.
# ch-test-scope: skip
#
# To build and push:
#
#   $ VERSION=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
#   $ podman build -t charliecloud/ocimanifest:$VERSION \
#                  -f Dockerfile.ocimanifest .
#   $ podman images | fgrep ocimanifest
#   $ podman login
#   $ podman push charliecloud/ocimanifest:$VERSION
