# The purpose of this script is to make it more convenient to search the
# project source code. It's a wrapper for grep(1) to exclude directories that
# yield a ton of false positives, in particular the documentation's JavaScript
# index that is one line thousands of characters long. It's tedious to derive
# the exclusions manually each time.
#
# grep(1) has an --exclude-dir option, but I can't get it to work with rooted
# directories, e.g., doc-src/_build vs _build anywhere in the tree, so we use
# find(1) instead. You may hear complaints about how find is too slow for
# this, but the project is small enough we don't care.
