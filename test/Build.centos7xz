# This GitHub repository is arranged with CentOS version and architecture in
# different branches. However, the matrix is not complete: by branch, you can
# download any architecture at the latest version, or a specific version of
# x86_64, but not a specific version of aarch64. Therefore, we download by
# commit hash.
#
# To check what version is in a tarball (on any architecture):
#
#   $ tar xf centos-7-${arch}-docker.tar.xz --to-stdout ./etc/centos-release
#
# ch-test-scope: standard

set -ex

#srcdir=$1  # unused
tarball=${2}.tar.xz
#workdir=$3  # unused

# 7.6.1810
arch=$(uname -m)
