fatal_msg () {

usage () {
    cat <<'EOF' 1>&2
Test that ch-image can upgrade storage directories generated by old versions,
i.e., unpack each old storage directory from a tarball, then try to upgrade it
and run the test suite.

Usage:

  $ old-storage.sh SCOPE WORKDIR TAR1 [TAR2 ...]

WORKDIR is where ch-image storage are unpacked. It must be empty and have
enough space for one storage directory.

TARn are old storage directories arechived as tarballs. These must have
certain properties:

  1. Named storage-$VERSION.$ARCH.tar.gz, e.g. “storage-0.27.x86_64.tar.gz”.
     (Note: $ARCH is not currently validated but may be in the future.)

  2. Is a tarbomb, e.g.:

       $ tar tf storage-0.26.x86_64.tar.gz | head -3
       ./
       ./dlcache/
       ./dlcache/alpine:3.9.fat.json

  3. The result of:

       $ rm -Rf $(ch-image storage-path) && ch-test -b ch-image build

     or equivalent, though mostly rather than fully successful tests are fine.

     Note: Best practice is to generate the tarball at the time of release,
     because old test suites often don’t pass due to changing source images.
